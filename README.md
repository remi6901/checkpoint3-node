# NODE MUSIC - CHECKPOINT 3

## Disclaimer

The checkpoint is quite consequent, it's no big deal if you don't do everything before the deadline. Do your best, and most importantly HAVE FUN 😃

# The checkpoint itself 🔥

## :zero: Setup | 30sec

Before starting anything technical, your first mission is to clone this project, then create a branch with your lastname and firstname like so : `lastname_firstname`

## :one: Step[1] - Database modeling | 20 min

We want to build a website that allows users to discover and share cooking recipes. Your mission here is to provide a **logical data model** that meets the following constraints for the application :

- Users must be able to identify themselves on the application with a username and password.
- Several recipes can exist for a specific dish. Each dish is defined by his name and his type (starter, main course or dessert)
- Each recipe is defined by : a title, an author, a date of creation, a list of ingredients and an ordered list of steps. A recipe is always related to a dish.
- For each recipe, we should be able to find the steps of the recipe as well as the order in which they need to be done.
- For a given recipe, for each ingredient we should be able to find the quantity and the unit.
- Finally, each user must be able to add a recipe to his favorites.

### To properly model your database :

- Start by identifying **entities** and defining their **relationships** (with cardinalities) through a **conceptual data model**. Use paper/pencil to draft this first model.
- On the basis of the previous model, design the **logical data model**
  by adding attributes, foreign keys and/or junction tables.

You can use the tool of your choice to produce the database model :

- ✏️ Paper and pencil (my recommendation)

- 🛠️ any diagram drawing applications like [Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/fr/products/workbench/), [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), [Google Drawings](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-drawings/mkaakpdehdafacodkgkpghoibnmamcme/related?hl=fr)...

Once you're satisfied with your data model, take a picture, a screenshot or export as an image and commit it to your branch.

## :two: Step[2] - NodeJS / Express | 3 hours

### Getting started :point_down:

The project comes with a boilerplate, _nearly_ already configured. (Eslint and Prettier)

n the project directory, you can run different scripts:

- `npm run dev` : Runs the app in the development mode using `nodemon` on port 8000 by default. You can change it by creating a `PORT` variable in your `.env` file. (You should create this file)
- `npm start`: Runs the app in production mode. This will **not re-start when you write your code !**
- `npm run lint` : This app came with basic ESLint config (Prettier + React), you can run a check every time using this script. :collision: BEWARE :collision: If you don't have Prettier installed in your Editor with format on save, you should run it with the next script
- `npm run prettier` : It runs Prettier on all your staged files. (only useful if you don't have Prettier installed in your editor)
- `npm test` : This is the most important command for this checkpoint. It will test your CRUDs with `jest`. More informations below.

**In this step, you will create an API that allows you to manage songs and albums using Node/Express**

_Please please, don't forget to make atomic commits with explicit messages_ :pray:

Here is the database schema you need to create beforehand.  
You can use either SQL database you like (MySQL, SQLite, Postgresql), but cannot use noSQL (MongoDB for example).

:warning: The keys name should be the same as the schema and case sensitive, otherwise integration tests will fail ! :warning:

_don't write `albumId` instead of `id_album` for example_.

---

### Rules

- :white_check_mark: Response bodies should be JSON.
- :white_check_mark: Request bodies should be JSON.
- :white_check_mark: `PUT` and `DELETE` request should return `204 no content`.
- :white_check_mark: `POST` request should return `201 created` with the associated created resource.

### Tests

This checkpoint comes with integration tests on most of the routes.

- :loud_sound: GET `/api/tracks`
- :loud_sound: GET `/api/tracks/1`
- :loud_sound: POST `/api/tracks`
- :loud_sound: PUT `/api/tracks`
- :loud_sound: DELETE `/api/tracks`
- :headphones: GET `/api/albums`
- :headphones: GET `/api/albums/1`
- :headphones: GET `/api/albums/1/tracks`
- :headphones: POST `/api/albums`
- :headphones: PUT `/api/albums`
- :headphones: DELETE `/api/albums`

:warning: You **NEED** to have a track in your database with the `id` 1, and an album with the `id` 1.  
Otherwise, 3 tests are going to fail.

### Project architecture

This checkpoint comes with an already created architecture.

```sh
src
├── api
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── albums
│   │   ├── albums.routes.js
│   │   ├── getAll.js
│   │   └── ...
│   └── tracks
│       ├── tracks.routes.js
│       ├── getAll.js
│       └── ...
├── app.js
├── index.js
└── middlewares.js
```

You should not have to worry about cors, body parser, error middleware, etc.  
Every `module.exports` and `require` are done. You don't have to worry about it ! _Unless you create new files of course_

---

### Your mission

All you have to do, is writing your own logic in each route files in each route file (`getAll`, `getOne`, `post`, `update`, `delete`).  
Here are some user stories about what you need to do:

- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve the full list of tracks
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve one track by its ID
- As a user, I need to be able to create a new track
- As a user, I need to be able to update a track
- As a user, I need to be able to delete a track
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve the full list of albums
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve one album by its ID
- As a user, I need to be able to retrieve the tracks list of one album
- As a user, I need to be able to create a new album
- As a user, I need to be able to update an album
- As a user, I need to be able to delete an album

_Remember: for the tests to work properly, you need an `album` with id `1` and a track with id `1` in your DB !_

## :three: Step[3] - Quiz | 5 min

Your instructor will provide you the quiz link. You will need to login with Github in order to access it.  
Once you have validated it, you can check your answers on your `profile` page :

## It's done ! Congrats !

You can now chill :beers:
